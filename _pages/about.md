<font size = 10>I am a lecturer in computer science at Sichuan University. I obtained my Ph.D in computer science and technology  from Sichuan University in 2017, where I was advised by Prof. Bing Guo and Prof. Mei Hong. <br>
From 2017.7 to 2021.7, I worked as a  senior engineer at Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, and back to my alma mater as a postdoctor thereafter. <br>
My primary research focus is on the verification of intelligent Cyber-Physical Systems, which spans over <b>machine learning, formal methods, and embedded real time systems<b>.
